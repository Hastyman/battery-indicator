# battery-indicator
Simple battery threshold circuit for 9v powered projects. LED will flash once if available voltage is 7.5V or greater.
If the LED doesn't flash, then it's probably time for a new battery soon.

I was looking for a small, yet effective, battery indicator and this one works great. PCB is available at OSHPark and the 
board is on 21.5mm x 18.7mm so it fits in tight spaces. This means you can probably retrofit it to some of your favorite projects.
